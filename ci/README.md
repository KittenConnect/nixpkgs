# CI support files

This directory contains files to support CI, such as [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/master/.github/workflows) and [Ofborg](https://github.com/nixos/ofborg).
This is in contrast with [`maintainers/scripts`](`../maintainers/scripts`) which is for human use instead.
